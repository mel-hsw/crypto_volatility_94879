# API-specific requirements (FastAPI service)
# Used by Docker API container only - DO NOT install manually
# 
# This file is separate from requirements.txt because:
# - FastAPI requires pydantic>=2.0
# - Evidently (in requirements.txt) requires pydantic<2
# - Docker isolates the API environment, avoiding conflicts

# Core dependencies
kafka-python>=2.0.2
six>=1.15.0  # Required by kafka-python
pandas>=2.2.0
numpy>=1.26.2
pyarrow==14.0.1

# ML and modeling
# Pin to same version as requirements.txt to ensure model compatibility
# Models are trained with scikit-learn==1.3.2, so API must use same version
scikit-learn==1.3.2
xgboost==2.0.3

# MLflow for experiment tracking (optional for API)
mlflow==2.9.2
sqlalchemy==2.0.23

# Pydantic 2.x (required by FastAPI)
pydantic==2.12.4

# FastAPI and API dependencies
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
prometheus-client==0.19.0

# Environment management
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Rate limiting
slowapi==0.1.9

# Structured logging (JSON format)
python-json-logger==2.0.7

# Note: Evidently is excluded from API requirements as it requires pydantic<2
# Evidently is only needed for drift monitoring scripts (requirements.txt), not the API service
